# SpinIcons
This code creates a 3D carousel effect for icons, where each icon rotates around a central axis. The carousel is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling and animation. The perspective and transform-style: preserve-3d properties create the 3D depth, while a keyframes animation (@keyframes carousel) handles the continuous rotation.
